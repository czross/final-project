	<h2>What we are working on now</h2>
	<p>The EventDoc development process opened our eyes to many other outdated systems used in medicine to record the multitude of events that take place in a hospital. Using the EventDoc framework we have started to develop a system that is geared toward Trauma patients that would allow easy and intuitive record keeping, with easy access to the records so medical providers can access them instantly when needed.</p>
